Dancer::App::Base::HTML5Bootstrap
=================================

Dancer::App::Base::HTML5Bootstrap is a base application for [Perl
Dancer](http://perldancer.org/). The idea is to give Dancer developers a base
application which takes care of many of the basic features of any web app
including authentication, a sign-in form and logout page, a basic
account/dash-board page, a registration page and some core SQL for the accounts.

It uses HTML5 so that it is compatible with modern browsers, and uses BootStrap
for the CSS framework and jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX support.
